The program is written with syntax of python3.7 on PyCharm on Windows,
So using PyCharm to run this program might be a better choice

The program crawls website urls from the net based on the original top 10 results of Google.
All the results are saved in 'venv/result.txt'.

The main program is in "test.py"
All you need to do is follow input information, like this
	search:wildfires california
	maximum pages (-1 means infinite search):100
	enter 1 or 2 (1 means focused crawling, 2 means BFS crawling):1

There is no number limitation of input items
